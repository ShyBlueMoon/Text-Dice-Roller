Project: Dice Roller App - Image Version
==================================


Introduction
------------

This is a project to demonstrate the concepts I learned on Android development for a six sided dice app.

What this app does
--------------
This dice game has a button to roll the dice using a random number generator from 1 to 6. For each side rolled it will change to a new static image depicting the side of the rolled dice.
